# LearningtoLearn

I found this paper Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent is particularly interesting. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04474.pdf

I found this piece of code (https://github.com/LlionJ/blog/blob/master/blog/Meta-Learning.ipynb) useful as well. The small project is mainly to use the existing code and modify a bit to help me a better understanding of meta-learning.
